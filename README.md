## **Overview**
This repository contains the code and datasets for the study titled "Development of a Policy Framing Model for Online Filipino News Using Multilingual Large Language Models: Extending MARISOL."

This study extends the MARISOL project, which developed an automated classification system for policy issue frames in English-language Philippine online news. It explores and evaluates new classification models for Filipino-language articles, aiming to contribute to a more inclusive and linguistically representative approach to media frame analysis in the local context.
