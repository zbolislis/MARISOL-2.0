"MANILA – The Philippine Information Agency (PIA), in partnership with the National Defense College of the Philippines (NDCP) of the Department of National Defense (DND), has underscored the importance of disseminating government policies and programs  the spread of fake news and misinformation and uphold national security.  The two agencies insisted on the stance as a high delegation of the National Defense College of the United Arab Emirates (NDC-UAE) paid a courtesy visit to the country alongside an institutional briefing.  In an interview, PIA Director-General Ramon Cualoping III said national security risks are no longer limited to kinetic, but more of cognitive warfare. “Cognitive so dapat naiintindihan ang mga proyekto, polisiya, programa ng pamahalaan. Kung hindi naiintindihan, nagkakaroon ng mistrust o pag-agam-agam, pagdududa sa ating pamahalaan. At kapag ‘yan nangyari, magiging vulnerable ‘yung ating mga kababayan para sa mga bagay which can affect national security (Cognitive, so the projects, policies and programs should be understood. If it’s misunderstood, there’s a mistrust, hesitations or doubts in our government. And once that happens, Filipinos shall be vulnerable to threats that may affect the national security),” he said.  Cualoping said although the government cannot dictate its people, explaining the administration’s program and projects is vital to ensure public trust.  “Ngayon, cognitive na e. Meaning cerebral, kung paano mag-isip ang isang tao, kung ano ‘yung thought process ng isang tao. That’s why dito sa PIA, gusto nating maging thought leaders ‘yung mga kababayan natin (Nowadays it’s cognitive. Meaning cerebral, or how the people think, how a person has his thought process. That’s why here in PIA, we want our fellow Filipinos to be thought leaders),” he added.  On the other hand, the spread of inaccurate information may hinder the dissemination of administration’s programs that are supposedly beneficial for Filipinos.  “There’s Twitter, Facebook, Tiktok, everything is there. Everyone has  a content producer or a creator. But now, the role of the government is to safeguard the entire state and the entire citizenry. Which means, whatever the government releases, the people should understand. Because the government has no program that will harm the people,” he said in mixed English and Filipino.  Moreover, NDCP acting Vice President for Academic Affairs and Dean Dr. Alan Lachica said fake news or misinformation can turn down a government system.",8,7
