"MANILA – The Department of Agriculture (DA) on Monday underscored the importance of food safety to public health, as it seized around PHP120 million worth of smuggled agri-fishery products in Navotas City.  In a radio-TV interview, DA Assistant Secretary for Inspectorate and Enforcement James Layug said the DA, together with partner agencies, inspected and raided seven warehouses in Navotas on March 17.  “‘Yung isang pinasok po natin, talyer po e. Pero sa loob niya, mayroong dalawang ‘yung plug-in na tinatawag. May container van sa loob na refrigerated tapos nakasaksak lang sa kuryente. Tapos sa loob naman, talagang gumawa lang ng kwarto tapos nilagyan ng mga refrigerated section  (One raided area is an auto garage shop. But inside, it has two so-called plug-ins. It has a refrigerated container van inside, plugged in electricity. Then inside, they made a room with a refrigerated section  he said.  Among the confiscated products include frozen pompano, pangasius, shrimp, chicken, frozen beef, frozen boneless beef, frozen spare ribs, frozen pork parts, frozen pork aorta, frozen squid rings and frozen pacific saury. However, Layug said more than the avoidance of necessary taxes and permits, the risk of having smuggled goods on the table is a health concern.  “Mas importante ay ‘yung food safety issue. Hindi ito dumaan sa tamang proseso. Hindi ho na-inspect o nabigyan ng sanitary phytosanitary clearance. So ang problema po natin dito is ‘pag napunta po ito sa public market o mga hapagkainan, danger ng public health issue (The food safety issue is more important. This is not undergoing the right process. It’s not inspected nor given sanitary phytosanitary clearance so our problem here is if it reaches the public market or the tables, the danger is a public health issue),” he said.  Layug added that this is possible since consumers do not usually search for the supply source when in the public market.  “May deception din ito. Kasi hindi naman ilalagay ‘yung ano e, kasi mga expired po ‘yung iba e. Ire-rebox lang nila ito, kapag ibinenta sa palengke, mga talipapa. Kung ikaw consumer, hindi mo naman na titingnan saan galing ito, titingnan mo kung mura (There’s a deception here because they are not putting (the expiration date), some are even expired. Others are just reboxed, then sold to markets. If you’re the consumer, you will no longer check where it came from. You will just look for cheaper prices),” he said.  To date, the DA will still look into the sources of the confiscated smuggled agri-fishery products.  Moreover, the DA said it will investigate possible diversion or technical smuggling after the seizure.",9,8

To date, fishing activities in Caluya, Antique are also halted following the spread of the oil spill.

I feel that we have in our police, in our judiciary, a good system. We do not need assistance from any outside entity, the Philippines is a sovereign nation, and we are not colonies anymore of these former imperialists. So that is not something that we consider to be a legitimate judgment,” he added.   Marcos said that “until those questions of jurisdiction and the effects on the sovereignty of the Republic are sufficiently answered, I cannot cooperate with them.”   Duterte pulled the Philippines out of the Hague-based tribunal in 2019 after it began a preliminary probe into the crackdown, followed by the launch of a formal inquiry later that year.",13,12
