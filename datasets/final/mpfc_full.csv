Kailangang may natutunan sa naging banta sa hanapbuhay ng ating seafarers (We must learn from this threat to the livelihood of our seafarers). Hence, it is imperative that concerns voiced by seafarers themselves, such as unreasonable fees, corruption in training and maritime schools, requirements, and others, be given greater consideration,” she said in a statement.   “It is also important to observe that the majority of negative findings were due to deficiencies in the education system. We call on the Commission on Higher Education and the MARINA (Maritime Industry Authority) to continue to remedy such deficiencies,” she added.   Hontiveros said she would continue to advocate for the passage of the Magna Carta of Seafarers to protect and advance the rights and well-being of seafarers.   Senator Grace Poe echoed the statement of Hontiveros, saying there should be continuous training to increase the viability of Filipino workers.   “The continued recognition by the European Union of the certificates for Filipino seafarers is a crucial decision that will keep them onboard ships. During this turbulent period of the global economy, we cannot afford job losses that will bring economic difficulties to millions of families,” Poe said in a separate statement.   “As Filipino seafarers remain the preferred choice in the EU region, we should embark on continuous skills training to increase the viability of our workers. The government and private sector should step up efforts to use the period allowed by the EU to boost training and seriously heed the issues raised by the European Maritime Safety Agency,” she added.   Poe said the quality of maritime education would ensure the safety of travelers and secure the future of Filipino seafarers’ families.   Senator Joel Villanueva said he trusted the country’s maritime authorities and that they will continue to enhance efforts to  with the International Convention on Standards of Training, Certification and Watchkeeping for Seafarers (STCW Convention).",6,5

We have the technical capabilities and the experts,"" Phivolcs Director Teresito Bacolcol told the Philippine News Agency. Raymond Patrick Maximo, Phivolcs Science Research Specialist, said these equipment include Inductively Coupled Plasma-Optical Emission Spectroscopy, X-ray Fluorescence, Fourier-transform Infrared Spectrometer, etc.  Bacolcol said the PNRI will place equipment on active faults to measure the radon gas. Phivolcs, on the other hand, will trace where these active faults are located.  He added that the partnership is essential also because the PNRI checks potential sites for nuclear power plants.  Meanwhile, according to Phivolcs, the two agencies will work on projects in the fields of geochemistry, isotopic techniques, volcanism, active faults, geothermal and volcano-hydrothermal. ""Isotopic techniques are ways to analyze isotopes. We would like to develop methods to measure isotopes in the substance. In the case of volcanoes, (we will) measure isotopes in volcanic deposits or rocks,"" Maximo told the PNA. Sulfur isotopes, for example, will tell whether there is new magma involved in a volcanic eruption, he said. Under the partnership, Phivolcs will provide technical support for fieldwork and sample collection. It will also facilitate data acquisition from local sources. Aside from coordinating with the PNRI for joint publication of study findings, the Phivolcs will also use the projects' output in future operations if isotopic techniques are proven accurate in identifying the movements of active faults.  The PNRI, on the other hand, will coordinate project activities with local officials and residents. The PNRI will regularly conduct radon and thoron measurements for monitoring the movements of active faults.  Among other activities, the PNRI will facilitate mineral chemistry, geochronological and geochemical analyses in partner institutions.",2,1

"MANILA – The Philippines and the European Union (EU) on Monday launched the Copernicus Capacity Support Action Programme for the Philippines (CopPhil), a first in the region space cooperation program worth PHP610 million. Copernicus is the EU's earth observation flagship program that provides free environment and climate data derived from a constellation of satellites – the Sentinels -- which monitor the earth and its many ecosystems 24 hours daily. CopPhil seeks to aid Philippine authorities develop national systems to make use of EU’s earth observation’s satellites data in disaster mitigation and climate change adaptation and food security strategies. ""To be most effective in reducing disaster risk, an integrated systems approach to governance, featuring strong coordination and cooperation across sectors and levels is needed,"" said Department of Science and Technology (DOST) Secretary Renato Solidum Jr. during the launch in Pasay City.He added that if the country could prevent hazards from  disasters, it could also futureproof its development and economic gains.  Solidum said the demand for innovative approaches that can create disaster resilience have  bigger. The Philippines, for instance, is constantly confronted with climate and disaster risks, and is vulnerable to its impacts, he pointed out. ""CoPhil will develop and leverage our own Space Science and Technology applications to strengthen the nation’s resilience to disasters and climate change,” he said. He added that the agency has been utilizing Sentinel datasets for land cover mapping, aquaculture monitoring, and forest and watershed management monitoring around the Philippines. Using the Copernicus data collection system would support the Philippine government's decision-making and policy implementation monitoring based on timely and accurate data, Solidum said. He also said the data would help the government gain an improved understanding of hazards and risks from the space perspective, identify challenges and identify analysis tools to support planning and decision-making. For his part, EU Ambassador to the Philippines Luc  that the cooperation program will lead to ""a stronger and more shock-resilient Filipino economy and society."" Véron also said the EU is exploring the possibility to create a network of Copernicus partners in the Asean of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) region aside from other parts of the world. ""The uptake of innovative technologies such as Copernicus will trigger growth, jobs and modernization of digital infrastructures that can be used in many sectors in the Philippines,” he said.  Philippine Space Agency Director General Joel Marciano Jr.  the partnership with the EU, saying it would boost the domestic space value chain, particularly in processing and using satellite images and space data.  ""CopPhil is an integral part of our efforts to mobilize space data for societal benefit and value, for strengthening the country's domestic space value chain, and for positioning the Philippines as a hub for space data mobilization excellence in the region,"" he said. Marciano cited as an example that PhilSA has provided Copernicus Sentinel data to the Department of Agriculture for road network monitoring, movement of goods, hazard mapping and ship detection. The open data from Copernicus, he said, has also enabled access to crucial data such as volcanic emission monitoring, mapping of canopy heights, crops, among others.",14,13

"MANILA – The Department of Agriculture (DA) on Monday underscored the importance of food safety to public health, as it seized around PHP120 million worth of smuggled agri-fishery products in Navotas City.  In a radio-TV interview, DA Assistant Secretary for Inspectorate and Enforcement James Layug said the DA, together with partner agencies, inspected and raided seven warehouses in Navotas on March 17.  “‘Yung isang pinasok po natin, talyer po e. Pero sa loob niya, mayroong dalawang ‘yung plug-in na tinatawag. May container van sa loob na refrigerated tapos nakasaksak lang sa kuryente. Tapos sa loob naman, talagang gumawa lang ng kwarto tapos nilagyan ng mga refrigerated section  (One raided area is an auto garage shop. But inside, it has two so-called plug-ins. It has a refrigerated container van inside, plugged in electricity. Then inside, they made a room with a refrigerated section  he said.  Among the confiscated products include frozen pompano, pangasius, shrimp, chicken, frozen beef, frozen boneless beef, frozen spare ribs, frozen pork parts, frozen pork aorta, frozen squid rings and frozen pacific saury. However, Layug said more than the avoidance of necessary taxes and permits, the risk of having smuggled goods on the table is a health concern.  “Mas importante ay ‘yung food safety issue. Hindi ito dumaan sa tamang proseso. Hindi ho na-inspect o nabigyan ng sanitary phytosanitary clearance. So ang problema po natin dito is ‘pag napunta po ito sa public market o mga hapagkainan, danger ng public health issue (The food safety issue is more important. This is not undergoing the right process. It’s not inspected nor given sanitary phytosanitary clearance so our problem here is if it reaches the public market or the tables, the danger is a public health issue),” he said.  Layug added that this is possible since consumers do not usually search for the supply source when in the public market.  “May deception din ito. Kasi hindi naman ilalagay ‘yung ano e, kasi mga expired po ‘yung iba e. Ire-rebox lang nila ito, kapag ibinenta sa palengke, mga talipapa. Kung ikaw consumer, hindi mo naman na titingnan saan galing ito, titingnan mo kung mura (There’s a deception here because they are not putting (the expiration date), some are even expired. Others are just reboxed, then sold to markets. If you’re the consumer, you will no longer check where it came from. You will just look for cheaper prices),” he said.  To date, the DA will still look into the sources of the confiscated smuggled agri-fishery products.  Moreover, the DA said it will investigate possible diversion or technical smuggling after the seizure.",9,8

"MANILA – The Philippine Information Agency (PIA), in partnership with the National Defense College of the Philippines (NDCP) of the Department of National Defense (DND), has underscored the importance of disseminating government policies and programs  the spread of fake news and misinformation and uphold national security.  The two agencies insisted on the stance as a high delegation of the National Defense College of the United Arab Emirates (NDC-UAE) paid a courtesy visit to the country alongside an institutional briefing.  In an interview, PIA Director-General Ramon Cualoping III said national security risks are no longer limited to kinetic, but more of cognitive warfare. “Cognitive so dapat naiintindihan ang mga proyekto, polisiya, programa ng pamahalaan. Kung hindi naiintindihan, nagkakaroon ng mistrust o pag-agam-agam, pagdududa sa ating pamahalaan. At kapag ‘yan nangyari, magiging vulnerable ‘yung ating mga kababayan para sa mga bagay which can affect national security (Cognitive, so the projects, policies and programs should be understood. If it’s misunderstood, there’s a mistrust, hesitations or doubts in our government. And once that happens, Filipinos shall be vulnerable to threats that may affect the national security),” he said.  Cualoping said although the government cannot dictate its people, explaining the administration’s program and projects is vital to ensure public trust.  “Ngayon, cognitive na e. Meaning cerebral, kung paano mag-isip ang isang tao, kung ano ‘yung thought process ng isang tao. That’s why dito sa PIA, gusto nating maging thought leaders ‘yung mga kababayan natin (Nowadays it’s cognitive. Meaning cerebral, or how the people think, how a person has his thought process. That’s why here in PIA, we want our fellow Filipinos to be thought leaders),” he added.  On the other hand, the spread of inaccurate information may hinder the dissemination of administration’s programs that are supposedly beneficial for Filipinos.  “There’s Twitter, Facebook, Tiktok, everything is there. Everyone has  a content producer or a creator. But now, the role of the government is to safeguard the entire state and the entire citizenry. Which means, whatever the government releases, the people should understand. Because the government has no program that will harm the people,” he said in mixed English and Filipino.  Moreover, NDCP acting Vice President for Academic Affairs and Dean Dr. Alan Lachica said fake news or misinformation can turn down a government system.",8,7

" You qualify for benefits as a survivor if you were married to your spouse for at least nine months before the employee died. A spouse can receive half of a retired worker's full benefit unless the spouse begins collecting benefits before full retirement age. You should also know that if you remarry, your benefits could be affected. Generally, you won't be eligible for widow or widower benefits if the remarriage occurs before age 60, or age 50 if you are disabled. Down the road, you are entitled to benefits even in the event of a divorce. If you split up but your marriage lasted 10 years or longer, you can still receive benefits based on your ex-spouse's record.

Financier Carl Icahn nominated himself and eight others on Friday for election to the RJR Nabisco Holdings Corp. board, saying his slate would break up the food and tobacco company by spinning off its food holdings. Icahn had signaled his intentions on Thursday when he said he was dissatisfied with RJR Nabisco's plan to spin off its U.S. tobacco operations as a separate company owned by RJR shareholders. His filing of a competing slate of candidates for the RJR board sets up a showdown at the May 12 annual meeting, when shareholders can decide which breakup plan they prefer. Carol Makovich, a spokeswoman for RJR, said the company had no comment on Icahn's filing. RJR Nabisco, which was the target in the biggest and most dramatic takeover battle of the 1980s, owns the nation's second-biggest tobacco company led by the Winston, Salem and Camel cigarette brands. It also owns an 80.6 percent stake in Nabisco Holdings Corp., which is traded separately and is the nation's biggest cookie and cracker maker with brands such as Oreos, Chips Ahoy!, Snackwells and Ritz. Both Icahn and RJR management feel the food company would fare better in the stock market if its ties were severed to the tobacco business, which faces hundreds of lawsuits. But they disagree over how to make the split. In addition to Icahn, his nominees include Jerome Becker, Harold First, Seymour Fliegal, Russell Glass, Martin Hirsch, Robert Mitchell, Felix Pardo and Jack Wasserman. None appears to have any experience in the tobacco industry. Glass and Mitchell work for companies Icahn heads, and they sit with First and Wasserman on another company board chaired by Icahn. Hirsch works for a real estate investment partnership with an address that matches where another Icahn firm is based. Becker is a lawyer, Fliegal is an educational consultant and Pardo is a business executive.",1,0

"Holt's Cigar Holdings Inc., which rode the 1990s popularity of expensive handmade cigars to an initial public offering in 1997, is going private.

The Philadelphia company's publicly held shares will be bought by a company controlled by Holt's chief executive officer, Robert G. Levin, and members of the cigar-making Fuente family for $5.50 each, about half the amount that investors paid for the shares three years ago, the company said yesterday.

Holt's was one of several companies serving the premium-cigar market to go public in the mid-1990s when the segment was booming, making it easy to raise capital. Growth in the sale of premium cigars peaked at 68 percent in 1996. Since then, growth has slowed dramatically, and profits have declined as the segment has become saturated.

Wall Street quickly lost interest in the companies, and Holt's is the last of them to leave the stock market.

""I think going private is the right thing to do,"" said Mitchell B. Pinheiro, an analyst with Janney Montgomery Scott L.L.C., which was a co-underwriter in the company's initial public offering.

Holt's sold 1.75 million shares to the public at $11 each in November 1997, netting $17.1 million. By the following September, the stock traded for just over $3.

""The stock-price performance since [the] IPO reflects the lack of investor interest in the industry, which coincided with the end of the cigar boom,"" said Anthony A. Latini Jr., a director at Berwind Financial L.P., which reviewed the going-private transaction.",1,0

"The Episcopal Church, which has been strained by gay-rights issues since the election of an openly gay bishop in New Hampshire eight years ago, is now divided over how to respond to the legalization of same-sex marriage in New York.

As a result, gay and lesbian Episcopalians will be allowed on Sunday to get married by priests in Brooklyn and Queens, but not in the Bronx or Manhattan or on Staten Island; in Syracuse but not in Albany.

That is because the church has not taken a firm position nationally on same-sex marriage, leaving local bishops with wide latitude to decide what priests may do when the law takes effect in New York State. In the state, with six Episcopal dioceses, the bishops are split: two have given the green light for priests to officiate at same-sex marriages, one has said absolutely not, two are undecided and one has staked out a middle ground, allowing priests to bless, but not officiate at, weddings of gay men and lesbians.

The Episcopal Church, known as one of the most welcoming to gay men and lesbians among mainline Protestant denominations, finds itself in an uneasy position on the issue -- embracing neither the clear stance against same-sex marriage taken by Roman Catholic, evangelical Protestant, Muslim, Mormon and Orthodox Jewish leaders, nor the supportive position of Reform Jewish, Unitarian Universalist and many liberal Protestant leaders. The Episcopal Church is a small denomination -- the church claims 172,623 members in New York State -- but is also prestigious and influential.

"The ongoing battle over redefinition of marriage threatens to shatter a long-standing, popular approach to personal faith and biblical morality.

For several generations, most Americans have embraced what could be described as the Goldilocks attitude toward religion: affirming faith choices that seemed not too soft but not too hard, not too hot but not too cool. Majorities viewed easy-going moderation and comforting compromise as the religious path that counted as ""just right.""

Conservative Judaism -- the ""middle branch"" of the ancient faith -- always exemplified the ""Goldilocks"" orientation with its emphasis on the ""sweet spot"" between stringencies of Orthodox observance and the anything-goes adaptability of Reform. But just before Passover, the Conservative movement's  flagship institution, The Jewish Theological Seminary (JTS), announced a controversial decision highlighting the painful contradictions of middle way religions.

Following the findings  of an expert panel filed last December, JTS signaled its intention to accept openly gay candidates for the rabbinate and to raise no objection to their involvement in same-sex commitment ceremonies.  For a movement that still stresses time-honored standards of Sabbath observance and kosher food, this represents a stunning break with tradition. A spiritual leader proudly, publicly promoting consumption of pork would never fit in with the Conservative rabbinate, but this same denomination now will sanction rabbis who call unblushing communal attention to their personal practice of sexual relations that the Torah describes as ""abomination.""

"When leaders of the United Methodist Church's Northern California and Nevada region meet here on June 15, they will begin grappling with the unusual decision of whether to charge 68 ministers with violating church law for having jointly blessed a same-sex union in January.

The ceremony was public, held in the convention center here, with more than 1,000 people attending and wide news coverage.

A church spokesman said that never before had so many ministers faced the possibility of a formal charge of disobedience, which could lead to a church trial. Trials themselves, in which a conviction can carry penalties as severe as removal of ministerial credentials, have been rare -- until recently -- in the denomination, which has 8.5 million members.

In March, the Rev. Greg Dell, a minister in Chicago, was suspended from office by an ecclesiastical court after it found him guilty of violating church law for having blessed the union of two gay men.

A year earlier, the Rev. Jimmy Creech, of Omaha, Neb., was acquitted after conducting a ceremony for two women. But Mr. Creech's bishop removed him from his pulpit. An official complaint, which can lead to a trial, has been filed against Mr. Creech for a same-sex union he recently performed in North Carolina.

These events illustrate the escalating tension within many mainline Protestant churches over how to respond to gay and lesbian members. Among Methodists, the second-largest Protestant denomination after the Southern Baptist Convention, the debate has focused on clergy members' blessing same-sex unions.

"The United Church of Christ became the first mainline Christian denomination to support same-sex marriage officially when its general synod passed a resolution on Monday affirming ''equal marriage rights for couples regardless of gender.''

The resolution was adopted in the face of efforts to amend the Constitution to ban same-sex marriage. It was both a theological statement and a protest against discrimination, said the Rev. John H. Thomas, the president and general minister of the denomination, which has 6,000 congregations and 1.3 million members.

''On this July 4, the United Church of Christ has courageously acted to declare freedom, affirming marriage equality, affirming the civil rights of gay -- of same-gender -- couples to have their relationships recognized as marriages by the state, and encouraging our local churches to celebrate those marriages,'' Mr. Thomas said at a news conference after the vote by the General Synod.

The synod's decisions are not binding and the vote will not require pastors to provide marriage ceremonies for same-sex couples. Some United Church of Christ ministers already perform such ceremonies.

While the United Church of Christ has not had the widespread divisions other major denominations have experienced over homosexuality, some member churches had said that such a vote could prompt them to leave the denomination, and one group called for Mr. Thomas's resignation when he announced his support of the resolution.

"The Supreme Court announced on Wednesday that it would decide whether state and local gun control laws may be challenged under the Second Amendment.

The court also agreed to hear nine other cases from among those that had piled up over its summer break, including one concerning the constitutionality of an antiterrorism law that is a favorite tool of federal prosecutors.

The Second Amendment case, McDonald v. Chicago, No. 08-1521, addresses a question that was left open last year when the court decided that the Second Amendment protects an individual right to own firearms rather than a collective right tied to state militias.

Last year's decision, District of Columbia v. Heller, concerned only federal laws and struck down parts of the gun control law in the District of Columbia, a federal enclave. The court ruled that the law violated the Second Amendment by barring law-abiding people from keeping guns in their homes for self-defense.

The new case was brought by residents of Chicago who say their city's handgun ban is identical to the one struck down in Heller.

Several Supreme Court decisions, all more than a century old, have said that the Second Amendment does not apply to the states.

In June, the United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit, in Chicago, affirmed the dismissal of the new case, saying it was up to the Supreme Court to overrule its own precedents if it wished to do so. Chief Judge Frank H. Easterbrook, writing for a unanimous three-judge panel of the appeals court, added that it was not certain whether and how the Supreme Court might apply the Second Amendment to the states.

New York's highest court heard arguments in two cases on Tuesday that could have profound effects on the  battle over same-sex marriage.

The cases, which the court, the New York State Court of Appeals, is considering jointly, concern relatively narrow executive and administrative orders in recent years that extended benefits like health insurance to same-sex spouses of government employees who married in jurisdictions where such  marriages are legal, and, in one county, required local officials to treat same-sex couples as married.

But a broad enough ruling by the Court of Appeals could force businesses and local governments in the state to recognize out-of-state marriages between same-sex couples, effectively legalizing the unions of thousands of New Yorkers who were married in Vermont, Iowa, parts of Canada and other places where same-sex marriage is legal.",5,4

"Cigarette smoking may play a major role in more than half of the cases of severe gum disease in adults nationwide, suggesting that one of the main causes of tooth loss could be prevented, a government study shows.

While it has long been known that smoking can help cause gum disease, this is the first national study to show how widespread the problem is, said Dr. Scott Tomar, a researcher with the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

Current smokers were about four times more likely than people who never smoked to have periodontitis, but ex-smokers who had abstained for 11 years faced no increased risk, according to Tomar, whose findings were published in the May issue of the Journal of Periodontology. Overall, 52.8 percent of periodontitis in the study was attributed to current and former smoking.

"Dear Dr. Donohue - My mother is in her early 70s. She has been diagnosed with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, COPD. She had a bronchoscopic exam to remove a mucus plug. She was a very heavy smoker. She still smokes. She thinks her kids don't know, but we have seen the evidence. She is on oxygen. Her doctor thinks she has quit. What does this do to her life expectancy? How long can she live this way? - J.S.

Answer - Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, COPD, is two illnesses: emphysema and chronic bronchitis. Emphysema is a harmful stretching and destruction of the millions of air sacs found in the lungs. Through those delicate structures, oxygen reaches the blood. When they are damaged, a person cannot get enough oxygen and becomes breathless on even slight exertion. Chronic bronchitis is inflammation of the air passageways, the bronchi. They fill with thick, pus-filled globs of phlegm. Air cannot pass through them. A cough that produces of sticky, tenacious sputum is its chief sign.

Cigarette smoking is the major cause of COPD, but not the only one.

It's hard to watch people ruin their bodies and hasten death. Tell her that the most important treatment for COPD is total abstinence from smoking. Abstinence allows lungs to recover from the damage done from inhaling cigarette smoke. It doesn't achieve a complete reversal overnight. It does prolong life.",9,8

Therefore medical schools don't think it's important, according to Dr. Linda Ferry, the associate professor at Loma Linda University School of Medicine who conducted the study. What's more, most insurance programs don't reimburse doctors for helping patients quit smoking. Consequently, doctors pressured by HMOs to see large numbers of patients each day can't afford to spend the four to six hours of treatment it takes, on average, to help a smoker quit. That means that doctors are effectively unable to address the main health problem of many of their patients.",9,8

For the study, metabolic syndrome was defined as having at least three of five characteristics: a big waist, high blood pressure, high levels of blood fats called triglycerides, low levels of good cholesterol, and evidence of insulin resistance, in which the body cannot efficiently use insulin.

In the study, published yesterday in the American Heart Association online journal Circulation, researchers found that 6 percent of 12-to-19-year-olds had the syndrome and that the prevalence increased with exposure to tobacco smoke.

The study found that 1 percent of those unexposed to smoke developed the syndrome, 5 percent of those exposed to secondhand smoke had the disorder, and 9 percent of active smokers had it.

When researchers looked at teens who were overweight or at risk of being overweight, the effect was even more marked, with 6 percent of those not exposed to smoke developing syndrome, 20 percent of those exposed to secondhand smoke getting it, and 24 percent of smokers suffering from the disorder.",9,8

The station is in a plain-looking set of office buildings in Clarkston, a city that over the years has seen unparalleled change as more refugees and immigrants moved to the area.

Listeners have become neighbors, and Mohamed said it's not unusual to have people casually drop by the second-floor studio to meet the voices behind the mic.

Sagal Radio is a community-based nonprofit that broadcasts radio programs every Friday, Saturday and Sunday in six different languages --- English, Somali, Amharic, Karen, Bhutanese/Nepali and Swahili. Programs are broadcast in various languages at different times during those days. It also streams online. People can also listen by dialing 832-551-5083 or by downloading the Sagal Radio app on Android phones.

"Marvel Comics' superheroes have met their match: a 7-year-old.

The comic book giant is eliminating cigarette and cigar smoking from its superheroes trading cards because of a complaint from Sammy Blum.

Sammy wrote to the New England Journal of Medicine, which printed his letter in today's edition.

""I collect Marvel Masterpieces,"" Sammy wrote. ""So do some of my friends and my brothers. I found five out of 100 cards that were smoking!!""

Sammy listed the offending characters, both heroes and villains: Blaze, Gambit, Kingpin, Nick Fury and Red Skull.

""Why do they make cards for kids that show people smoking?"" wrote Sammy, the son of family physician Alan Blum, who is chairman of a Houston anti- smoking group called Doctors Ought to Care.

In a reply printed below a copy of Sammy's letter, Marvel Entertainment Group President Terry Stewart, whose company owns such characters as X-Men, Captain America and Spider-Man, announced it would eliminate smoking from future cards. Marvel spokeswoman Pamela Rutt said Sammy's letter ""really did open our eyes."" She said the company had no plans to reconsider the use of smoking characters in comic books, ""but . . . it might come up.""",11,10

""From earliest colonial times, the needs of the wilderness and the threat of Indians had put firearms in the American household. The right to bear arms had been hallowed in the Constitution.""

But in a new book due this fall, a historian challenges what he calls a modern myth and argues that gun ownership in the frontier era was far from universal. In ""Arming America: The Origins of a National Gun Culture"" (Knopf), Michael A. Bellesiles (pronounced buh-LEEL) contends that only a relative few private citizens actually owned firearms between 1765 and 1850. Fewer still owned guns that worked, he says, and only an elite, typically professional hunters and sportsmen, could reliably aim and fire a weapon.

Perhaps no more than 10 percent of the total American population owned guns at any time before 1850, according to a variety of records cited by Mr. Bellesiles, an associate professor of history at Emory University in Atlanta.",11,10

"Freud once said that occasionally a cigar is merely a cigar. In the movies, at least, a cigarette has never been merely a cigarette, although the meanings and uses of cigarettes have changed over the decades.

Compare two movies 50 years apart. In ""The Maltese Falcon"" in 1941, Humphrey Bogart rolls his own. The tobacco pouch that proclaims his toughness and masculinity dangles from his jacket pocket. In ""Regarding Henry"" in 1991, the wages of chain smoking are having your brains splattered on the floor of a convenience store. Harrison Ford wouldn't have been shot in the head if he hadn't gone out to buy a pack of cigarettes -- almost literally his coffin nails.

The movies, of course, have always played the dual role of reflecting and shaping what society considers proper. With this year's Great American Smokeout scheduled for Nov. 19, many Americans are deciding that it is time to shred that cigarette into the garbage disposal, to rub out the embers in the ashtray, to toss the pack into the trash. On screen, villains still have the habit, but real heroes no longer smoke.

""I would not have any protagonist smoke in a movie unless it was a period film,"" says the producer Daniel Melnick, who was off nicotine for eight years until he bummed a cigarette from a crew member when he was making ""Air America"" in Thailand in 1989. ""Audiences want the ability to idealize themselves in the stars.""",11,10

With backing from Hoyer (D-Md.) and other key lawmakers, the bid to add one seat for the District and another for Utah is expected to pass, legislators said. It would then go to the Senate, where its prospects are less certain.

The District government will form a task force to help implement reforms of its troubled emergency response system as part of a legal settlement with the family of a slain New York Times journalist whose case was poorly handled by police and ambulance workers.

"Asked whether she thought the Court might take the issue up this Term, Justice Ginsburg noted that all three appellate courts to address the issue so far (the Fourth, Seventh, and Tenth) have struck down state laws limiting marriage to opposite-sex couples. She added that we are still awaiting a decision from the Sixth Circuit, which has been considering a same-sex marriage claim since oral argument on August 6. ""Sooner or later,"" she predicted, the Court will decide the issue. But given that there is no disagreement so far, she concluded, there is ""no urgency"" for the Court to take it right now.
