Financier Carl Icahn nominated himself and eight others on Friday for election to the RJR Nabisco Holdings Corp. board, saying his slate would break up the food and tobacco company by spinning off its food holdings. Icahn had signaled his intentions on Thursday when he said he was dissatisfied with RJR Nabisco's plan to spin off its U.S. tobacco operations as a separate company owned by RJR shareholders. His filing of a competing slate of candidates for the RJR board sets up a showdown at the May 12 annual meeting, when shareholders can decide which breakup plan they prefer. Carol Makovich, a spokeswoman for RJR, said the company had no comment on Icahn's filing. RJR Nabisco, which was the target in the biggest and most dramatic takeover battle of the 1980s, owns the nation's second-biggest tobacco company led by the Winston, Salem and Camel cigarette brands. It also owns an 80.6 percent stake in Nabisco Holdings Corp., which is traded separately and is the nation's biggest cookie and cracker maker with brands such as Oreos, Chips Ahoy!, Snackwells and Ritz. Both Icahn and RJR management feel the food company would fare better in the stock market if its ties were severed to the tobacco business, which faces hundreds of lawsuits. But they disagree over how to make the split. In addition to Icahn, his nominees include Jerome Becker, Harold First, Seymour Fliegal, Russell Glass, Martin Hirsch, Robert Mitchell, Felix Pardo and Jack Wasserman. None appears to have any experience in the tobacco industry. Glass and Mitchell work for companies Icahn heads, and they sit with First and Wasserman on another company board chaired by Icahn. Hirsch works for a real estate investment partnership with an address that matches where another Icahn firm is based. Becker is a lawyer, Fliegal is an educational consultant and Pardo is a business executive.",1,0

Anytime, let it go kung may isang may critical number, ibigay mo,” Pimentel, who served as Senate president in the 17th Congress but was later on replaced by former Senator Vicente Sotto III, said in an online interview.  “Bigay mo na. Siya ang nakabuo ng minimum number ng 13, and then siya na ang mag-steer ng ship at alagaan niya lahat ng mga egos [at] mga interest ng mga kasama niya,” he added.  Speaking from experience, Pimentel said it was a challenge to handle his colleagues’ egos and interests.  “Mahina kasi ang party system natin. Wala namang party-backing ang ating mga leaders of Congress. Hindi by party e. At saka kung may party man sya, not sufficient in numbers. There is no guarantee sa stability in the leadership,” he said.  In the current political structure, support for the Senate presidency was mostly gathered through personal relationships and through  interests in governance, Pimentel explained.",13,12

""PNRI has the equipment. We need their help because they know how to run these equipment. We have the technical capabilities and the experts,"" Phivolcs Director Teresito Bacolcol told the Philippine News Agency. Raymond Patrick Maximo, Phivolcs Science Research Specialist, said these equipment include Inductively Coupled Plasma-Optical Emission Spectroscopy, X-ray Fluorescence, Fourier-transform Infrared Spectrometer, etc.  Bacolcol said the PNRI will place equipment on active faults to measure the radon gas. Phivolcs, on the other hand, will trace where these active faults are located.  He added that the partnership is essential also because the PNRI checks potential sites for nuclear power plants.  Meanwhile, according to Phivolcs, the two agencies will work on projects in the fields of geochemistry, isotopic techniques, volcanism, active faults, geothermal and volcano-hydrothermal. ""Isotopic techniques are ways to analyze isotopes. We would like to develop methods to measure isotopes in the substance. In the case of volcanoes, (we will) measure isotopes in volcanic deposits or rocks,"" Maximo told the PNA. Sulfur isotopes, for example, will tell whether there is new magma involved in a volcanic eruption, he said. Under the partnership, Phivolcs will provide technical support for fieldwork and sample collection. It will also facilitate data acquisition from local sources. Aside from coordinating with the PNRI for joint publication of study findings, the Phivolcs will also use the projects' output in future operations if isotopic techniques are proven accurate in identifying the movements of active faults.  The PNRI, on the other hand, will coordinate project activities with local officials and residents. The PNRI will regularly conduct radon and thoron measurements for monitoring the movements of active faults.  Among other activities, the PNRI will facilitate mineral chemistry, geochronological and geochemical analyses in partner institutions.",2,1

The actual situation on the ground is also being monitored to assess possible damage to crops and livestock.  Meanwhile, the DA said it will also implement usual interventions for farmers that may be possibly be affected.

"The Feb. 10 Commentary article by lesbian Amy Adams Squire Strongheart was the most ridiculous theology I have ever read. Her delusion that the term ""eunuch"" could possibly mean gay - thus affirmed by Jesus - is absurd. It is not a point of biblical interpretation; it is simply garbage theology.

The Holy Scriptures do clearly state that homosexuals are people of a depraved mind (Romans 1), so this would explain her interpretation and the fact that this blasphemy was allowed in the Post-Dispatch. Homosexuality is condemned by God and will only yield death and eternal damnation for these people. Homosexuals need to confess their sins and receive forgiveness, not attempt to rationalize it with nonsense theology.

It is time for Christians to offer tough love to a people who have a life expectancy on this Earth of less than 40 years, and an eternal life in hell. The homosexual lifestyle is a ticket to destruction.  Rev. Dale J. Pritchard Hillsboro, Ill.  Amy Adams Squire Strongheart's Feb. 10 Commentary article about same-sex marriages made a case to prove homosexuality is affirmed in the Bible. She is wrong again. The eunuchs the book of Matthew 19:4-12 is referring to are men who were castrated by other men as a punishment or converted men of a pagan religion priesthood or men born impotent. Never, in any case, does it describe the gay lifestyle.  Theo Parmer Sr.  Florissant For some time, I have been following the obvious overexposure of the sexual orientation of Amy Adams Squire Strongheart in the Post-Dispatch. I have been trying to determine what purpose the paper has in publishing these outlandish articles by an avowed lesbian.

"MANILA – Authorities arrested a screening personnel for allegedly stealing a watch from a passenger at the Ninoy Aquino International Airport (NAIA) Terminal 1 on Wednesday.  The Office for Transportation Security (OTS) said at around 2:30 a.m., Security Screening Officer Valeriano Ricaplaza Jr. allegedly took the watch of a foreign passenger while undergoing the security screening procedure. The OTS added that Ricaplaza initially denied the act when asked by the passenger. However, CCTV footage showed that Ricaplaza took the item, the OTS said. Ricaplaza was arrested and is currently under the custody of the Philippine National Police Aviation Security Group for further questioning. In a statement, Manila International Airport Authority (MIAA) General Manager Cesar Chiong said the management strongly condemns such unscrupulous, illicit and selfish act. ""Theft violates the trust and integrity required of public servants, and has serious negative consequences for the airport, its stakeholders, and the country as a whole,"" he said. On Monday, the OTS reported that six cases involving erring personnel are being looked at. These include violation of the ""No Tipping"" policy, violation of the proper disposal of intercepted prohibited items, extortion, among others. The recent alleged extortion from a Thai passenger went viral on social media. House Deputy Speaker Ralph Recto said the incident only worsened the image of the country's main gateway. “A few erring OTS employees have dealt the nation a black eye. Na-tag na nga ang NAIA as one of the world’s worst airports, lalo pang pinalala ng insidenteng ito (NAIA’s previous tag as the world’s worst airport has been worsened by this incident),"" Recto said in a statement on Tuesday.

We want show the Filipinos na hindi masayang yung budget na binigay sa OTS,"" he told the Philippine News Agency.
